# Advanced-Network-Design-for-Pak-Modern-Hotel
This project designs and simulates a secure, scalable hotel network in Cisco Packet Tracer. It uses routers, switches, and subnets to connect departments with services like FTP, DNS, Web, Email, DHCP, and Telnet. The design ensures efficient routing, centralized management, and reliable communication across the hotel.
